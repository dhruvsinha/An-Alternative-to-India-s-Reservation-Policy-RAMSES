# An Alternative to India's Reservation Policy-RAMSES

## Abstract 

Affirmative action in the form of reservations is a divisive
and contentious topic of policy in India. In this paper, we
create the first principled and data-driven model to design the
reservations policy in India. We look at various issues that
critics present against the current reservation policy and try
resolve them, while pursuing a (provably) more effective and
efficient system of empowerment. We use intelligent statistical
modelling to create our new framework, RAMSES (Rigorous
and Adaptive Measurement of Socio-Economic Status). RAMSES measures the multidimensional disadvantage faced by an
individual as an “adjusted income”. This adjusted income calibrates the quantum of compensatory aid required in the form
of reservations for that individual to have a level playing field.
A flexible and dynamically adaptive framework like RAMSES
will empower policymakers, reduce bias, and become more
broadly accepted in society as a foundation on which rational
negotiations for reservations can happen, instead of the politically charged (and often violent) altercations that currently
drive these processes.

## Motivation

We see that the current system of reservation has its own set
of issues which policy makers and politicians have tried to
address in different ways. The current reservation system
provides and cares for group identities leading to the elite
among the group to become the biggest beneficiaries. The
provision to exclude the ‘creamy layer’ helps in keeping the
economically elite OBCs out of the reservation system. The
‘creamy layer’ however does not take into consideration that
there are other factors at play too which create an elite among
a certain group. Should we not prioritise women over men
when providing for reservation benefits if we see that men are
better off on all parameters as compared to women? If yes,
how will this prioritisation work? Scheduled castes from one
state might be facing a lot more discrimination as compared to
some other state. Should we not give more reservation benefits
to the more backward scheduled caste?

With so many complexities involved, it is not ideal to have a
homogeneous reservation policy across the length and breadth
of this country. Today, we have access to several datasets
and econometric tools which can let us deal with fairness (or
unfairness) of reservation policy at the level of the individual.
To motivate discussion for the need of a quantitative framework, we plot some important distributions. We compare top
10% of Scheduled Castes and OBCs (income wise) with bottom 10% of Forward Castes (including Brahmins). We first
plot the the distribution of number of Assets owned by each
Household.
