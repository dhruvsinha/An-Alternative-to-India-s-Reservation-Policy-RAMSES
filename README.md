# An-Alternative-to-India's-Reservation-Policy-RAMSES

Affirmative action in the form of reservations is a divisive
and contentious topic of policy in India. In this paper, we
create the first principled and data-driven model to design the
reservations policy in India. We look at various issues that
critics present against the current reservation policy and try
resolve them, while pursuing a (provably) more effective and
efficient system of empowerment. We use intelligent statistical
modelling to create our new framework, RAMSES (Rigorous
and Adaptive Measurement of Socio-Economic Status). RAMSES measures the multidimensional disadvantage faced by an
individual as an “adjusted income”. This adjusted income calibrates the quantum of compensatory aid required in the form
of reservations for that individual to have a level playing field.
A flexible and dynamically adaptive framework like RAMSES
will empower policymakers, reduce bias, and become more
broadly accepted in society as a foundation on which rational
negotiations for reservations can happen, instead of the politically charged (and often violent) altercations that currently
drive these processes.
